# Results

Here is example code for a table with a caption in Table \@ref(tab:table1).

```{r table1}
cars %>% 
  head %>% 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, 
        caption = "Preview of the `cars` dataset.")
```

Here is example code for a figure with a caption Figure \@ref(fig:plot1).

```{r plot1, fig.cap="Plot of the `cars` dataset"}
ggplot(cars, aes(x = dist, y = speed)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
